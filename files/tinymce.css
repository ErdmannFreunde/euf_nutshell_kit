/**
 * Global TinyMCE style sheet
 *
 * Use this style sheet to define CSS classes for the rich text editor. The
 * stlye sheet will be included in the editor and the page layout automatically.
 * Although the stlye sheet is shared by all themes, you can override its
 * formattings in any of your theme style sheets.
 *
 *   files/tinymce.css (this is how it looks like in TinyMCE)
 *   .warning { color:#c55; }
 *
 *   theme_a.css (this is how it looks like in theme A)
 *   .warning { font-weight:bold; }
 *
 *   theme_b.css (this is how it looks like in theme B)
 *   .warning { color:#000; }
 *
 * If you do not want to use a global TinyMCE style sheet at all, simply delete
 * this file (files/tinymce.css).
